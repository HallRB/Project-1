- NAVIGATION: The user will be presented with a series of buttons with options that, when pressed, will  reveal a hidden slide that corresponds with the selection made. if the user makes it to the end screen, win or lose, they will have their score recorded and will be asked if they want to start the game over again.

- SCORING: As the user navigates through the options, the TIMER and the PANIC METER will be visible. When the user makes an advisable choice, their panic meter will go down and they will have additional time added. The opposite will occur if the user selects a less advisable option.
